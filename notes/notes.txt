How they relate to stability:

Length ↑ = Stability ↓ (longer = harder to fold correctly)
GC Content ↑ = Stability ↑ (G-C pairs have 3 hydrogen bonds vs A-U's 2)
MFE (more negative) = Stability ↑ (lower energy = more thermodynamically favorable)
Stems = Stability ↑ (paired regions hold structure together)
Loops/Bulges ↑ = Stability ↓ (unpaired regions = weak points)

Physical basis:
Stable RNA = tightly folded structure that doesn't fall apart

More base pairing (stems) = more hydrogen bonds = harder to unfold
Lower free energy (MFE) = thermodynamically stable
Compact structure (short, high GC) = less likely to misfold

Model learns: Which combination of these features = stable vs unstable RNA
------------------------------------------------------
GC_Content: Out of total bases (G+C+A+U)

0.60 = 60% of all bases are G or C


Avg_Stem_Length: Average number of base pairs in each stem

If 3 stems with lengths 6, 8, 10 → avg = 8


Paired_Bases_Pct: Percentage of bases that are paired (in stems)

70% = 70 out of 100 bases are in stems, 30% in loops


MFE (Minimum Free Energy): From RNAfold software

Calculates thermodynamic energy of most stable fold
Based on nearest-neighbor model (empirical values)


Ensemble_FE: Average energy across ALL possible structures

RNA can fold multiple ways
MFE = best structure, Ensemble = average of all
